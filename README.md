# Demand for "Safe Spaces": Avoiding Harassment and Stigma

This repository contains the supplemental material and replication package for the 2019 Working Paper "Demand for 'Safe Spaces': Avoiding Harassment and Stigma" by Florence Kondylis, Arianna Legovini, Kate Vyborny, Astrid Zwager, and Luiza Andrade.

### Abstract
Sexual harassment is pervasive, yet its economic costs are largely undocumented. To capture these costs, we randomize the price women commuters in Rio de Janeiro face to ride in the women-reserved "safe space". We recruit 357 women riders to crowd-source information on their behavior and experience across 22,000 rides. Women riding in the public space experience harassment once a week. A fourth of riders are willing to forgo a subsidy equivalent to 20% of the fare to ride in the "safe space". Randomly assigning riders to the "safe space" reduces their experiences of physical harassment by 40%, implying a low-bound cost of avoiding physical harassment of 2.86 USD per incident. However, Implicit Association Tests reveal that commuters associate women riding in the public space with more openness to sexual advances. While the reserved space is safer in relative terms, this stigma may normalize harassment of women in the public space.
