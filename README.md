# Demand for "Safe Spaces": Avoiding Harassment and Stigma

This repository contains the supplemental material and replication package for the 2019 Working Paper "Demand for 'Safe Spaces': Avoiding Harassment and Stigma" by Florence Kondylis, Arianna Legovini, Kate Vyborny, Astrid Zwager, and Luiza Andrade.

### Abstract
Sexual harassment on a womanâ€™s commute is pervasive and widens the gender wage gap. To capture the economic costs of this violence, we randomize the price of a women-reserved "safe space" in Rio de Janeiro. We recruit 357 women riders to crowd-source information on their behavior and experience across 22,000 rides. Women riding in the public space experience harassment once a week. A fourth of riders are willing to forgo the equivalent of a 20\% fare subsidy to ride in the "safe space". Randomly assigning riders to the safe space reduces the incidence of physical harassment by 50\%, implying a low-bound cost of avoiding physical harassment of \$1.17 per incident. While the reserved space is safer in relative terms, Implicit Association Tests reveal that commuters associate women riding in the public space with more openness to sexual advances. This stigma may normalize harassment of women in the public space.
