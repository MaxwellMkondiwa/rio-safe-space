# Demand for "Safe Spaces": Avoiding Harassment and Stigma

This repository contains the supplemental material and replication package for the 2019 Working Paper "Demand for 'Safe Spaces': Avoiding Harassment and Stigma" by Florence Kondylis, Arianna Legovini, Kate Vyborny, Astrid Zwager, and Luiza Andrade.

### Abstract
What are the costs to women of harassment on public transit? We randomize the price of a women-reserved "safe space" in Rio de Janeiro and crowd-source information on 22,000 rides. Women in the public space experience harassment once a week. A fourth of riders are willing to forgo 20\% of the fare to ride in the "safe space". Randomly assigning riders to the "safe space" reduces physical harassment by 50\%, implying a cost of \$1.45 per incident. Implicit Association Tests show that women face a stigma for riding in the public space which may outweigh benefits of the safe space.
